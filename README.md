# LRNR Quiz Generator with Perplexity API
The LRNR app uses the Perplexity API to generate custom quizzes based on user input. Originally built using jQuery and Go, this project is a full refactor into a Node.js and React stack.

The goal of this project is to modernize the application, improve maintainability, and ensure responsiveness and accessibility across all devices while retaining the original appâ€™s functionality.
